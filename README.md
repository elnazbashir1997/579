# Ref-free-and-Training-free-Summ-Evaluation
we use source code of the original paper. But their code is unreadable and messy.
we use formulas in the article and implement them again.
We start from formula 1 and go forward step by step.
Unfortunately we try a lot but we couldn't use the codes of given Github(EvalBase)


our file for the evaluation metric: `ref_free_metrics/similarity_measurements/main.py`
