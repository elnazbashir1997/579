# Ref-free-and-Training-free-Summ-Evaluation
we use source code of the original paper. But their code is unreadable and messy.
we use formulas in the article and implement them again.
We start from formula 1 and go forward step by step.
Unfortunately we try a lot but we couldn't use the codes of given Github(EvalBase)
First, we tried to run the program on our machine (MacBook Pro M1) and based on this architecture, TensorFlow does not match it. So, we tried to install it from different sources such as HOMEBREW, and it finally installed but did not work ☹

So, we tried to use it on another machine (iMac 2013 – 8GB RAM) which took around 36 hours, but in the final steps, it gave an error.

So, we contacted Professor Bao and Ge Luo and described the situation. Ge advised us to run it on Colab. We did that, and unfortunately, it did not work too. So, Ge gave us access to the laboratory server, and it did not work too. We struggled with that several times, but unfortunately, we didn’t get any results.
